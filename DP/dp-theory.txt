### THOSE WHO CANNOT REMEMBER THE PAST ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT ###

dynamic programming (2 approaches in DP)
1. Memoization -> Top Down 
2. Tabulation -> Bottom Up 


MEMOIZATION [Top Down] = when we tend to store the values of 
    sub problems of a functions 
    which needs to  be re-computed in a map / table.


TABULATION [Bottom UP] = when we go from the base case to the required solution.

#recursion is a parent of DP.
#if there are choice in a question -> recursion (guaranteed)
but if recursion has multiple and same function calls -> DP (guaranteed)
also when we are asked for optimal/min/max solution -> DP (guaranteed)


DP -> used when recursion has overlapping sub problems.
