RECURSION => facts to remember 

- without a base condition, infinite recusion might lead to stack overflow / segmentation fault.
- segmentation fault / stack overflow : calling of a recursive function multiple times which can lead to over flow of the system's stack memory. 
- time complexity : O(n)
- space complexity : O(n)
